Hi folks, this is my very first post on this blog. In this post I will be going over some stuff you need to know to get started with web development. I hope it will be useful to beginners and why not remind something to intermediate or advanced web developers.
Without further a do, let's get started!!


It all started with the [Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet), a global network of computers and devices that are interconnected by the [Internet Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Protocol) which is a set of rules that standardize the way computers share data between each other and identify each computer by a unique [IP address](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address) on the Internet. 

Then came the [World Wide Web]() also known as the **Web**, it refers to all the public **websites** or **pages** that users can access on their local computers and other devices through the Internet.

A website is a collection of web pages that are interconnected by [Hyperlinks]() which are links that point to other web pages. 
Websites are hosted on other computers called [Servers](). To access a website, a user usually needs a [web browser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser) which is a program that send [Requests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_request) to a server and receives a response which is displayed on the user's screen. The browser is called a **Client**. 

When looking at a **webpage**, the content you see is more often created using 3 different languages:
- [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) - Used to create the content and describe the structure of a webpage.
- [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets) - Used to style the content of a webpage.
- [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) - Used to control the content of a webpage.

An HTML document is a collection of [HTML elements](), represented by **tags**. These elements can have one or more [attributes]() to change their appearance or behavior and are nested inside each other to form the **Document Object Model**( [DOM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model)).
