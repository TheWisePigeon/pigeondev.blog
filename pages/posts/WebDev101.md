Hi folks, this is my very first post on this blog. In this post I will be going over some stuff you need to know to get started with web development. I hope it will be useful to beginners and why not remind something to intermediate or advanced web developers.
Without further a do, let's get started!!


It all started with the [Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet), a global network of computers and devices that are interconnected by the [Internet Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Protocol) which is a set of rules that standardize the way computers share data between each other and identify each computer by a unique [IP address](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address) on the Internet. 

Then came the [World Wide Web]() also known as the **Web**, it refers to all the public **websites** or **pages** that users can access on their local computers and other devices through the Internet.

A website is a collection of web pages that are interconnected by [Hyperlinks]() which are links that point to other web pages. 
Websites are hosted on other computers called [Servers](). To access a website, a user usually needs a [web browser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser) which is a program that send [Requests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_request) to a server and receives a response which is displayed on the user's screen. The browser is called a **Client**. 

When looking at a **webpage**, the content you see is more often created using 3 different languages:
- [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) - Used to create the content and describe the structure of a webpage.
- [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets) - Used to style the content of a webpage.
- [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) - Used to control the content of a webpage.

An HTML document is a collection of [HTML elements](), represented by **tags**. These elements can have one or more [attributes]() to change their appearance or behavior and are nested inside each other to form the **Document Object Model**( [DOM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model)).

CSS, is used to style elements. It can be used inside of the element tags which is called **Inline styling**, or in a **style tag** nested in the DOM but also in a separate .css file, which is linked to the webpage and use **Selectors** to target elements in the DOM.

JavaScript is responsible of controlling the behavior of the elements, it helps developers build interactive and dynamic webpages. Like css, it can be used inside of a **script tag** or in a separate .js file, which is linked to the webpage.

These are the very basics thing you need to know to get started with web development, it might seem very small but it is very important to have a good understanding of these before moving up to the most advanced topics. With the daily evolution of the web, it has become very hard to build quality websites with just plain HTML and CSS. The rise of [Frameworks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Framework_(software)) and [Libraries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_(software)) has made it easier to build websites but has also added to the amount of knowledge needed to build on the web today. These Frameworks are based on HTML, CSS and JavaScript. That's why having a good understanding of how they work is not a waste of time.

This is the end of this post. I hope you enjoyed it and if you have any questions or comments, feel free to leave a comment below. I will make a series of posts on web development, this is the first one of them, and the next one will be named WebDev 1Ô∏è‚É£üÖæÔ∏è2Ô∏è‚É£. So if you are a beginner and want to learn web development from scratch to the most advanced topics, mind subscribiing to my newsletter and you will be notified when there is a new post.

Until next time, Stay safe and write code!!üê¶
